## Analysis Breakdown

### 1. Demographic Analysis

#### Age Calculation and Distribution
- **Calculation**: Determine the age of users by subtracting the birth year from the current year.
- **Visualization**: Plot age distribution to understand the age range of users and identify the most common age groups.

#### Gender Distribution
- **Analysis**: Count and visualize the number of users by gender to identify gender representation within the user base.
- **Segmentation**: Further segment analysis by other features like subscription plans and engagement metrics.

#### Top-Level Domains (TLD)
- **Distribution**: Analyze the frequency of different top-level domains in email addresses to understand user origins and email preferences.

### 2. Membership and Subscription Analysis

#### Subscription Plan Analysis
- **Overall**: Assess the distribution of different subscription plans among users.
- **Gender-Based**: Compare subscription plan preferences between male and female users.
- **Visualization**: Use bar charts and pie charts to represent the findings.

#### Subscription Start Day Analysis
- **Investigation**: Analyze which days users typically start their subscriptions to identify any trends or peak times for new sign-ups.
- **Visualization**: Utilize heatmaps and line graphs to illustrate subscription start day trends.

#### Membership Duration
- **Calculation**: Compute the duration of each membership by subtracting the start date from the end date.
- **Visualization**: Plot histograms or box plots to display membership duration and identify typical membership lengths.

#### Churn Analysis & Prediction
- **Factors**: Identify factors contributing to user churn such as low engagement, negative feedback, and non-renewal status.
- **Modeling**: Develop predictive models to identify users at high risk of churn.
- **Visualization**: Use scatter plots and decision trees to represent churn patterns and prediction results.

### 3. Payment Analysis

#### Payment Patterns
- **Overall Analysis**: Assess the prevalence of different payment methods among users.
- **Gender-Based Analysis**: Compare payment method preferences between male and female users.
- **Plan-Based Analysis**: Evaluate payment methods across different subscription plans.
